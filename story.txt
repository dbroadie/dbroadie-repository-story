There was once a Captain who sailed on the high seas. His name was Captain Williams, and he explored many islands.
One island had a volcano, and he collected rocks made of dried lava from this island. One island had many
precious gems, and he collected some and put them in his ship's hold. One island had many species of plants
that produced much food, and he collected samples of these plants to take home with him. As he became
more experienced, he became more ambitious, and he decided to sail further than he had before.

He made his way onto many more islands, discovering new fruit, trees, minerals and animals. His ship eventually 
started to run out of space. Captain Williams had a rule, he would not land on an island which already had people
living on it. But as storage ran out, he hoped that he could find an island where he might be able to store some of
his findings and treasures.

And then something cuuuhrazy happened!

It was the most crazy thing to ever happen in the captain's life! He was very suprised!

Captain Williams had come across a great empty island which had once been inhabited. It was no longer inhabitated.
Instead of people, there was a great tower made out of locked chests and safes. There were containers
of many kinds, from baskets to glass jars. One by one, Captain Williams unloaded all of his goods into the 
containers for some future explorer to find. He set the animals loose on the island, where there was a 
jungle that would supply plenty of food. Then, his work complete, he set sail for home. 

The End
