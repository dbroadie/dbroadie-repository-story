There was once a Captain who sailed on the high seas. His name was Captain Williams, and he explored many islands.
One island had a volcano, and he collected rocks made of dried lava from this island. One island had many
precious gems, and he collected some and put them in his ship's hold. One island had many species of plants
that produced much food, and he collected samples of these plants to take home with him. As he became
more experienced, he became more ambitious, and he decided to sail further than he had before.
